<h2>Introduction : Why enrichment and reprocessing matters?</h2>
<p>After World War II, many countries pursued, abandoned or obtained enrichment and reprocessing facilities.  Enrichment and reprocessing are two critical processes in the nuclear fuel cycle that have significant implications for both nuclear power generation and non-proliferation efforts. Understanding these processes and the types of facilities involved is key to grasping the complexities of nuclear technology and its dual-use nature.</p>
<p>Enrichment is the process of increasing the concentration of uranium-235 (U-235) isotopes in natural uranium. Natural uranium contains about 0.7% U-235, the isotope needed for nuclear fission in most reactors. Enrichment increases this concentration to between 3% and 5% for reactor fuel, known as Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU). However, if enriched to much higher levels (above 20%), it produces Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU), which can be used in nuclear weapons. The most common enrichment method today is by Gas Centrifuge, where uranium hexafluoride gas is rotated at high speeds to separate U-235 from U-238 based on their mass differences. Thereâ€™s another technique, known as Gaseous diffusion, less efficient than gas centrifuges, where uranium hexafluoride gas is passed through semi-permeable membranes to separate isotopes.</p>
<p>Reprocessing is the chemical process of separating plutonium and unused uranium from spent nuclear fuel. This process is typically pursued to recycle the material into new nuclear fuel. In some cases, this process is also used to extract plutonium for use in nuclear weapons or mixed oxide (MOX) fuel. Reprocessing plants involve complex chemical operations including the PUREX (Plutonium Uranium Redox EXtraction) process. These facilities are of particular concern in non-proliferation contexts because they can produce weapons-grade plutonium. They also involve handling and storage of large quantities of radioactive material, posing environmental and security risks.</p>
<p>Pursuing, abandoning, and obtaining enrichment and reprocessing (ENR) technologies are distinct concepts in the context of nuclear energy and non-proliferation, each carrying different implications and consequences.</p>
<p>Pursuing ENR refers to a nation's efforts to develop or acquire the capabilities to enrich uranium or reprocess spent nuclear fuel. This is often a complex process involving significant investment in technology, infrastructure, and human capital. Pursuing ENR can be driven by a variety of motivations, ranging from the desire for energy independence and the ability to produce fuel for nuclear reactors, to less transparent objectives like the development of a nuclear weapons capability. Nations pursuing ENR capabilities often face international scrutiny, as these technologies are inherently dual-use and can be diverted to create materials for nuclear weapons.</p>

<p>Abandoning ENR, on the other hand, involves a nation making a conscious decision to cease or forgo the development or operation of uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing facilities. This decision can be voluntary, often as part of an international agreement or a diplomatic negotiation, or it can be the result of external pressures, such as sanctions or security concerns. Abandoning ENR is typically seen as a positive step in terms of non-proliferation, as it reduces the potential for a country to produce weapons-grade materials.</p>
<p>Obtaining ENR is the process by which a nation acquires the technology, knowledge, or facilities to enrich uranium or reprocess plutonium, either through indigenous development, purchase, or transfer from another country. This process can be transparent and subject to international safeguards, particularly when intended for peaceful purposes like energy generation, or it can be clandestine, especially if associated with a covert weapons program. Once a nation obtained ENR for peaceful purpose these capabilities can be diverted to covert weapons program.</p>
<p>The differences between these three actions are significant. Pursuing ENR is an active process of developing or seeking these capabilities, which can raise international concerns about a nation's intentions. Abandoning ENR is generally seen as a move towards non-proliferation and can often be part of a diplomatic strategy or international commitment. Obtaining ENR is the culmination of the pursuit, the point at which a nation acquires the capability, whether for peaceful or military purposes. Each of these actions carries different implications in the realms of international diplomacy, security, and non-proliferation.</p>
<p>Enrichment and reprocessing are central to various sectors, including energy production, naval propulsion, nuclear weaponry, research, and medicine. Low-Enriched Uranium (LEU) is used as fuel in nuclear power reactors. LEU typically contains 3-5% Uranium-235, suitable for most commercial reactors. Recovers usable uranium and plutonium from spent nuclear fuel can be recycled into Mixed Oxide (MOX) fuel or new nuclear fuel, reducing the need for fresh uranium and managing nuclear waste more effectively. Enriched uranium is necessary for research reactors, which are used for scientific studies, neutron production, and training. The extraction of specific isotopes via reprocessing is used in various research applications, including nuclear physics experiments. Isotopes like Uranium-235 or enriched stable isotopes are critical in the production of medical isotopes used in diagnostic imaging and cancer therapy. Reprocessing is not directly involved in medicine, but the isotopes derived from reprocessing can be used in radiopharmaceuticals and radiodiagnosis. Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU), though at levels typically higher than LEU used in commercial reactors, is used in nuclear-powered naval vessels like submarines and aircraft carriers. This provides them with extended operational capability without refueling. In this context, it can be used for peaceful and military purpose. Both processes are also integral to the R&D of advanced nuclear weapons, including the development of new types of nuclear warheads and understanding the effects of radiation on materials and electronic systems.</p>
<p>The most important and dangerous utilization, in a context of nuclear non-proliferation, is the production of nuclear weapons. Indeed, both Highly Enriched Uranium (HEU) and Plutonium (Pu) are central to the construction of nuclear weapons due to their fissile properties.</p>

<p>As we said, Uranium enrichment involves increasing the concentration of Uranium-235 (U-235) in natural uranium, which naturally contains only about 0.7% U-235. For nuclear weapons, uranium needs to be enriched to over 90% U-235. This is achieved through enrichment facilities using technologies such as gas centrifuges or gaseous diffusion. Once HEU is obtained, it can be fashioned into a simple gun-type nuclear weapon, where two sub-critical masses of HEU are rapidly brought together to achieve a supercritical mass, triggering a nuclear explosion. All plutonium isotopes can be used in nuclear weapons but the most common is typically Pu-239, which is produced in significant quantities in reactors optimized for its production. Plutonium is used in more complex implosion-type nuclear weapons, where conventional explosives compress a sub-critical sphere of plutonium to achieve supercriticality.</p>
<p>The dual-use nature of enrichment and reprocessing technologies poses a significant challenge for non-proliferation. While these processes are integral to civilian nuclear power, they also provide the means to produce fissile material for nuclear weapons. </p>
<p>Various treaties and agreements aim to regulate the spread of enrichment and reprocessing technologies. The Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) and the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) play crucial roles in preventing the proliferation of nuclear weapons. The NPT, a landmark international treaty that came into force in 1970, is built on three pillars: the non-proliferation of nuclear weapons, the peaceful use of nuclear energy, and disarmament. The core principle of the NPT is to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons and weapon technology. This treaty establishes a framework where nuclear-weapon states pledge not to transfer nuclear weapons or assist non-nuclear-weapon states in obtaining them. In return, non-nuclear-weapon states agree not to seek or acquire nuclear weapons, while being allowed to pursue peaceful nuclear energy programs. </p>
<p>The IAEA, an independent international organization affiliated with the United Nations, functions as the key monitoring body to enforce the NPT's provisions. It promotes the peaceful use of nuclear energy and ensures that assistance provided for nuclear energy is not used for military purposes. The IAEA implements safeguards, which are a set of technical measures that enable the IAEA to verify the compliance of states with their commitments under the NPT. These safeguards include regular inspections of nuclear facilities, monitoring of nuclear material, and verification of state declarations about their nuclear activities. One of the IAEA's main tools to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons is the Comprehensive Safeguards Agreement, which non-nuclear-weapon states party to the NPT are required to sign. This agreement allows the IAEA to monitor and verify that states are not diverting nuclear materials from peaceful uses to nuclear weapons or other nuclear explosive devices.</p>
<p>The NPT and IAEA work together to prevent the spread of nuclear weapons. The NPT does this by establishing legal obligations for states to either not pursue nuclear weapons (if they are non-nuclear-weapon states) or to pursue nuclear disarmament (if they are nuclear-weapon states). The IAEA enforces these commitments by implementing safeguards and monitoring programs, ensuring that nuclear technology and materials are not used for weapon development. This framework of treaties and inspections has been instrumental in maintaining global nuclear non-proliferation</p>
<p>However, the NPT, primarily focused on preventing the spread of nuclear weapons, does not explicitly prohibit the use of ENR technologies by its signatories. Its framework permits the peaceful use of nuclear technology, including uranium enrichment and plutonium reprocessing, as long as these activities are under strict IAEA safeguards and are not diverted towards weapons development. This provision reflects one of the NPT's three pillars, which is the right to peaceful use of nuclear energy. Equally, the IAEA's mandate does not extend to prohibiting the development or use of ENR technology for peaceful purposes. Iran has interpreted the silence to mean that it has a right to enrich uranium, as part of its right to a civilian program.</p>

<p>The IAEA focus on ensuring that such activities are not used to divert nuclear material for the development of nuclear weapons. Countries with advanced nuclear capabilities, including ENR technologies, are expected to maintain strict control and oversight to prevent diversion for military purposes. However, the potential for proliferation remains a concern, especially in cases where countries may pursue these technologies under the guise of peaceful use but with the intent to develop nuclear weapons capability. The rapidity of the process for a state-actor to make a nuclear weapon once the required materials are gathered makes it almost impossible for the IAEA safeguards to detect and prevent the diversion of ENR technology. </p>
<p>Those aspect of the NPT and IAEA's framework has been a subject of concern and debate about their effectiveness.  The diversion of a peaceful nuclear program to develop nuclear weapons, is a complex process that involves both technical and political maneuvering. India's journey to becoming a nuclear-armed state, despite initially developing its nuclear program for peaceful purposes, provides a clear example of how such a diversion can occur. </p>
<p>India began its nuclear program in the 1950s with the stated goal of harnessing nuclear energy for peaceful purposes. This was in line with the global sentiment at the time, which saw nuclear technology as a path to modernization and energy security. India's program was initially supported by countries like Canada and the United States, which provided reactors and nuclear material under the assumption that it would be used for peaceful energy production. However, the dual-use nature of nuclear technology and the development of nuclear reprocessing capabilities allows India to extract plutonium from spent nuclear fuel and India acquired a sufficient quantity to make a bomb. India's successful test of a nuclear device in 1974, which it called a "peaceful nuclear explosion," demonstrated how a country could leverage its civilian nuclear technology and materials for military purposes. The test was conducted using plutonium produced at a reactor that was originally supplied for research and the generation of electricity. This act was significant as it was not in direct violation of any international agreements, since India had not signed the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT) at the time but demonstrate that a peaceful program can be diverted.  </p>
<p>But even if India would had signed the NPT, it would not have been a big obstacle. Indeed, the NPT authorize a state to withdraw from the agreement so the country would not violate any law if it decide to make a bomb after a withdrawal. Thatâ€™s what North Korea did. After using its right to use ENR for its civilian program, North Korea withdraw from the NPT in 2003 and carried out its first nuclear weapon test in 2006</p>
<p>A second aspect of nuclear proliferation appeared among non-state actors. Increasing the number of ENR facilities and the amount of HEU and plutonium in circulation on a global scale also increase the risks of terrorism and theft of nuclear materials. This risk combined to the relative ease of bomb-making may enable a non-state actor obtains a nuclear weapon.  Indeed, Terrorist groups obtaining HEU or plutonium could potentially construct a rudimentary but still devastating nuclear weapon. The design of a basic nuclear bomb is no longer a well-kept secret, and while building an actual nuclear device poses significant technical challenges, it is not inconceivable that a well-funded and organized terrorist group could overcome these obstacles. Facilities that enrich uranium or reprocess spent fuel contain materials that could be stolen and sold or given to rogue states or terrorist groups. Securing these materials is challenging, as it requires not only physical security measures but also robust accounting, monitoring, and oversight systems. In countries with less stringent security measures or where corruption is a problem, the risk of theft or diversion increases. The ease of making a bomb once HEU is acquired cannot be overstated. A gun-type fission bomb, the simplest kind of nuclear weapon, is technologically within reach for a group that has managed to acquire a sufficient quantity of HEU. This type of bomb was used in the Hiroshima attack and was deemed so simple as to be reliably effective without testing. This lowers the barrier to nuclear terrorism if HEU falls into the wrong hands.</p>
<h2>Conclusion</h2>
<p>This project provides an insightful analysis of various countries' motivations for pursuing or abandoning efforts related to enrichment and reprocessing. Common reasons for pursuing ENR include national security concerns, deterrence strategies, regional geopolitical pressures, the desire for prestige and technological advancement, and economic considerations. In contrast, reasons for abandoning ENR efforts often involve international diplomatic pressure, changes in domestic politics or leadership, economic challenges, and the realization of the risks and costs associated with nuclear development. These factors play a significant role in shaping a country's nuclear policy and its stance on ENR development. A considerable number of states with civilian nuclear programs could potentially transition to nuclear weapons development. The exact number is not fixed due to fluctuating technological capabilities and geopolitical conditions. To minimize proliferation risks, we must strengthen international treaties, improve oversight, and promote transparent nuclear energy programs. Technological barriers, political will, international non-proliferation frameworks, and the threat of sanctions are major deterrents. We may enhance new standards and agreement to reduce those risks.</p>

<p>The 123 agreements of the Atomic Energy act, and specifically the consent right, forbid the partner to enrich or reprocess any fuel provided by the US or produced with materials or facilities provided by the US without approval. The GOLD standard, derived from the landmark agreement between the US and the United Arab Emirates of 2009, go even further by prohibiting any fuel alteration within a country's territory and disallow the partners who do not possess ENR or reprocessing facilities to pursue such activities. It is the highest standard of non-proliferation. </p>
<p>There are also ongoing efforts to develop proliferation-resistant enrichment and reprocessing technologies. These technologies aim to reduce the risks of nuclear proliferation, particularly the diversion of nuclear material for weaponization. The focus is on designing nuclear fuel cycles and technologies that are less conducive to producing weapons-grade materials or that make the diversion of such materials more difficult and easily detectable. Proliferation-resistant enrichment technologies aim to limit the production of HEU. One approach is the development of enrichment technologies that are technically less capable of producing HEU or that have built-in features making it difficult and detectable if a state tries to modify the technology for this purpose. New reprocessing technologies are being explored to make it more difficult to separate plutonium suitable for weapons. These include methods that leave the plutonium in a form that is less suitable for weaponization or that are inherently more complex and challenging to divert for military purposes. Research is also focused on advanced nuclear fuel cycles that minimize the production of plutonium and other fissile materials that can be used in weapons. For example, some proposed reactor designs can burn up more of the plutonium and other actinides in spent fuel, thus reducing the amount of these materials that could potentially be diverted. </p>
<p>While these new standards and technologies are significant progress in non-proliferation efforts, they are not foolproof. Not all countries are subject to the same stringent requirements. Indeed, UAE has voluntarily agreed to the Gold Standard, but other countries may negotiate 123 Agreements without such commitments. This creates a patchwork of agreements with varying levels of non-proliferation safeguards. The global landscape of nuclear agreements is inconsistent and some countries may pursue nuclear cooperation agreements with nations that have less stringent non-proliferation standards. This can create loopholes and discrepancies in global non-proliferation efforts. Even with strict agreements in place, the possibility of developing indigenous capabilities or covertly pursuing weapons-related activities cannot be entirely ruled outâ€¦</p>
