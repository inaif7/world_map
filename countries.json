Due to Soviet hesitation Egypt exploited the recent Sino-Soviet split and approached China to purchase nuclear weapons or reprocessing technology. While weapons were summarily denied, reprocessing technology was offered, but both deals with China and the Soviet Union later fell through.

In continuing its efforts toward proliferation, Iraq made major investments in uranium enrichment technology, with a goal of producing 15 kg of 93% U-235 annually, at best lending toward the fabrication of a functional atomic bomb every other year with optimal bomb design. However, the program wasn’t successful or efficient, and was unable to produce a warhead before the Gulf War. \n\tIn the lead up to the Gulf War, Saddam Hussein decided to subvert IAEA safeguards to take closely monitored HEU fuel toward a “crash program” to make a functional atomic weapon.

While there is no present motion to enrich or reprocess in Saudi Arabia, they have made note of their intention to pursue atomic weapons should Iran obtain them, and Saudi Arabia’s close collaboration with Pakistan gives credence to their intention to arm should Iran go nuclear.",

    "content": "\tWhile Sweden’s nuclear agency was founded shortly after the cessation of World War II in 1947, Sweden’s pursuit of atomic weaponry began in the early 1950s out of fears of a Soviet naval invasion across the Baltic. Sweden sought to lend credibility to its defense strategy upon successful possession of nuclear weapons, yet ostensibly pursued nuclear technology for civilian power generation.\n\tSweden planned on building natural uranium reactors fueled with domestically-mined uranium, with the first planned in 1958. Use of the spent fuel was planned to be reprocessed for civilian fuel purposes and for Sweden’s atomic weapons program, in a reprocessing plant planned in 1963. However, the reactors required natural uranium for their fuel, and use of reprocessing for civilian and economic purposes would not be economically viable until the late 1970s. Because of the exorbitant costs of the construction of a plutonium reprocessing facility without any economic incentive, domestic opposition from the vast majority of the Swedish people and government, and intense diplomatic pressure applied by the United States, Sweden decided to abandon its nuclear ambitions in 1964.",

In line with Switzerland’s rather infamous national policy of neutrality, Switzerland conducted a multitude of proposals in the late 1950s and early 1960s to develop atomic weapons.\n\tWith initially favorable conditions for domestic weapons development, a plan was developed in 1963 to consider the timeline, feasibility, and cost of both uranium enrichment and spent fuel reprocessing. However, a decrease in defense spending in 1964 prevented the allocation of funds and orchestration of the proposal. Switzerland struggled to pursue a concrete bomb program because of a governmental lack of consensus, and a growing opposition movement toward both nuclear weapons and power inhibited the furthuring of Switzerland’s nuclear ambitions. With Switzerland’s 1969 signature on the NPT, Switzerland cemented their position on nuclear weapons and domestic proliferation efforts.",

    "content": "\tSyria’s nuclear program began in 1976 in the pursuit of domestic power generation. Syria’s first efforts toward nuclear power started with approaching both the Soviet Union and Argentina for a nuclear reactor, in 1985 and 1990, respectively. Upon the collapse of the Soviet Union, Syria’s plans for a reactor fell through, and Argentina cancelled its deal with Syria after pressure from the United States and Israel. \n\tSometime after the collapse of both reactor deals, the Syrian government met with North Korea officials to join in creating a Syrian atomic weapons program. Beginning in 2001, Syria and North Korea frequently met to plan and begin construction on a nuclear reactor identical to North Korea’s for the generation of plutonium from natural uranium. In addition to the plutonium formed from the North Korean-designed reactor, Syria was also in possession of two hot cells from a Chinese research reactor, which would have enabled Syria to start reprocessing the spent fuel produced by this reactor. \n\tSyrian nuclear ambitions ended in 2007, when an Israeli airstrike destroyed the reactor, which was discovered and confirmed by the international community to have been a covert nuclear reactor in the aftermath of the strike. Due to increased inspection and safeguards, aggressive counter-proliferation, and the Syrian Civil War, Syria’s domestic program to nuclearize has failed to produce any quantity of fissile material and likely completely abandoned.",

    "content": "\tTaiwan’s nuclear program began as a result of the United States’ Nixon Doctrine in 1969, as fears of US withdrawal and demilitarization of East Asia and the Pacific fueled domestic fears of a Chinese invasion. Because the United Nations had recently recognized the sovereignty of the People’s Republic of China over Taiwan’s Republic of China, Nixon’s visit to China caused a large sense of insecurity in Taiwan. \n\tTaiwan’s decision to pursue nuclear weapons was entirely borne by the necessity for tactical deterrence. Taiwan’s nuclear plan was to reprocess spent fuel from its heavy-water reactor. However, because Taiwan’s reactor was fueled with US fuel, Taiwan’s spent fuel was property of the United States, and under more oversight. After the discovery of reprocessing facilities by the United States in Taiwan, US pressure caused Taiwan to cease its reprocessing efforts. However, in direct violation of Taiwan’s 1976 agreement with the United States, Taiwan kept an active reprocessing facility operational, and by the time of the United States’ discovery Taiwan was within few years of obtaining a significant quantity of plutonium.\n\tDue to this 1990 discovery, Taiwan was the first country with a substantial nuclear program to be subjected to the NPT’s Additional Protocal, significantly increasing the difficulty of outmaneavering the IAEA’s safeguards.",

In this post-test period, rather than resume physical research and development, Tito focused on developing both the design of the bomb as well as sufficient civilian cover for the program, while Tito’s successor Mamula, would dedicate resources to its nuclear program. During the 1980s, Yugoslavia had an overt civilian nuclear program that closely mirrored the requirements of its military program, allowing its pursuit of nuclear weaponry greater cover. \n\tFinally, Yugoslavia’s nuclear weapons program was shuttered due to a lack of coordination and insufficient resources to designate to the program, while its civilian research program was halted and ended following the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Following the breakup of Yugoslavia, all remaining fuel, spent fuel, and waste was completely removed from the region. ",
